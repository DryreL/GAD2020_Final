***GAD2020 Final Project Details Document*** 

*Author of the Document: Ilke Yilmaz* 

**Game Concept Introduction:** 

- Max Payne is a story-based third person shooter game about a man who has lost everything, hustling to clear his name while trying to find the honest truth about the murder of his family by the famous drug lord’s junkies who sell Valkyr, V. 

**Level Concept Introduction:** 

- Using the same level theme from the original Max Payne, the level has been designed to be an abandoned subway station on New York, USA that is being used by the drug family that Max Payne is after. The main goal of the level is to grab the briefcase that is filled with Valkyr. In the process you start from the subway station itself moving forward to places that are being used for other purposes but a subway station now.
